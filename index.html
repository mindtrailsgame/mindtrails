<h2>Welcome to Mind Trails 🌿</h2>
<p>This is a card-based reflection game played in pairs. One person is the <strong>Seeker</strong>, and the other is the <strong>Guide</strong>.</p>
<p>The Seeker chooses a challenge or goal. Together, you will walk through <strong>6 card stages</strong> — each helping the Seeker explore, reframe, and move forward.</p>
<h3>🌀 How It Works:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Start with <strong>"Goal"</strong> cards to define a challenge.</li>
<li>Click <strong>“Draw”</strong> to get one reflection question.</li>
<li>Read it aloud and reflect together.</li>
<li>After a few cards (or when ready), click <strong>"Next Phase"</strong> to move to the next step.</li>
<li>You’ll continue through <strong>Support → Exploration → Challenge → Creativity → Action</strong>.</li>
</ol>

Participants:
  Anna (Coach)
  Lukas (Coachee)

Context:
  Lukas is feeling stuck at work — unsure whether to pursue a promotion or switch to a different career path.

🟠 START SCREEN (Instructions for Both)
Coach reads aloud:
  “Let’s go through six steps to explore your challenge. Each step has a few cards.
You’ll reflect on one question per phase. Let’s begin.”

⚪️ STEP 1 – Goal (White)
Anna: “Here’s the first question: What would you like to achieve in the next month?”
Lukas: “I’d like clarity about whether to go for this internal promotion or look elsewhere.”
Anna: “Okay, so you want more clarity. Is this more about figuring out if you still belong in this company?”
Lukas: “Yeah… I feel torn. I like the team but not the direction.”

🟢 STEP 2 – Support (Green)
Anna: “What personal strength has helped you in the past?”
Lukas: “Hm... Probably adaptability. I’ve shifted roles before and always landed on my feet.”
Anna: “That’s big. Can you think of a time that reminds you of now?”
Lukas: “Yeah — when I left sales to go into product design.”

🔵 STEP 3 – Exploration (Blue)
Anna: “What have you tried so far to reach your goals?”
Lukas: “I’ve updated my resume and had a few informal conversations... but I keep hesitating.”
Anna: “What’s behind the hesitation?”
Lukas: “I think it’s fear — of making the wrong move again.”

🔴 STEP 4 – Challenge (Red)
Anna: “What negative self-talk do you need to challenge?”
Lukas: “Probably that ‘I won’t succeed elsewhere.’ That’s a huge one for me.”
Anna: “And how true does that feel, really?”
Lukas: “Less true than it used to. I’ve made bigger jumps before.”

🟡 STEP 5 – Creativity (Yellow)
Anna: “If this situation were a story you’re writing, what surprising twist would you add to make it inspiring and fun?”
Lukas: (laughs) “Maybe I’d take a sabbatical to travel — and end up discovering a new field by accident.”
Anna: “That’s beautiful. It tells me you’re craving something more expansive.”

🟠 STEP 6 – Action (Orange)
Anna: “What’s one specific step you can take this week to move closer to your goal?”
Lukas: “I’ll set up a meeting with that recruiter I’ve been putting off. Just to talk.”
Anna: “Perfect. And I’ll follow up with you next week. Sound good?”
Lukas: “Yeah. Thanks — this really helped untangle things.”

🌀 End of Trail
Coach: “Looking back — what surprised you most? What do you want to carry forward?”

<h2>Welcome to Mind Trails 🌿</h2>
<p>This is a card-based reflection game played in <strong>pairs</strong>. One person is the <em>Seeker</em>, and the other is the <em>Guide</em>.</p>
<p>The Seeker chooses a challenge or goal. Together, you will walk through <strong>6 card stages</strong> — each helping the Seeker explore, reframe, and move forward.</p>
<h3>🌀 How It Works:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with "Goal" cards</strong> to define a challenge.</li>
<li>Click <strong>“Draw”</strong> to get one reflection question.</li>
<li>Read it aloud and reflect together.</li>
<li>After a few cards (or when ready), click <strong>"Next Phase"</strong> to move to the next step.</li>
<li>You’ll continue through <strong>Support → Exploration → Challenge → Creativity → Action</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>🎭 Full Example: Anna &amp; Lukas</h3>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Lukas is unsure whether to pursue a promotion or consider a career change. Anna is guiding him.</p>
<h4>⚪ Step 1: Goal</h4>
<blockquote>
        Anna: “What would you like to achieve in the next month?”<br/>
        Lukas: “I want to feel clear about whether to go for this promotion or explore something new.”
      </blockquote>
<h4>🟢 Step 2: Support</h4>
<blockquote>
        Anna: “What personal strength has helped you in the past?”<br/>
        Lukas: “Adaptability. I’ve changed roles before and handled it well.”
      </blockquote>
<h4>🔵 Step 3: Exploration</h4>
<blockquote>
        Anna: “What have you tried so far to reach your goals?”<br/>
        Lukas: “Updated my resume, but I keep hesitating.”<br/>
        Anna: “What’s holding that hesitation in place?”<br/>
        Lukas: “Fear of making the wrong move.”
      </blockquote>
<h4>🔴 Step 4: Challenge</h4>
<blockquote>
        Anna: “What negative self-talk do you need to challenge?”<br/>
        Lukas: “That I won’t succeed elsewhere.”<br/>
        Anna: “And how true does that feel?”<br/>
        Lukas: “Less true than it used to.”
      </blockquote>
<h4>🟡 Step 5: Creativity</h4>
<blockquote>
        Anna: “If this situation were a story, what inspiring twist would you add?”<br/>
        Lukas: “Maybe I take a sabbatical and stumble into a new opportunity while traveling.”
      </blockquote>
<h4>🟠 Step 6: Action</h4>
<blockquote>
        Anna: “What’s one small step you can take this week?”<br/>
        Lukas: “I’ll reach out to that recruiter I’ve been avoiding.”
      </blockquote>
<p>✨ They reflect together, feeling more focused and empowered.</p>

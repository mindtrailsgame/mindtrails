<h2>Welcome to Mind Trails üåø</h2>
<p>This is a card-based reflection game played in <strong>pairs</strong>. One person is the <em>Seeker</em>, and the other is the <em>Guide</em>.</p>
<p>The Seeker chooses a challenge or goal. Together, you will walk through <strong>6 card stages</strong> ‚Äî each helping the Seeker explore, reframe, and move forward.</p>
<h3>üåÄ How It Works:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with "Goal" cards</strong> to define a challenge.</li>
<li>Click <strong>‚ÄúDraw‚Äù</strong> to get one reflection question.</li>
<li>Read it aloud and reflect together.</li>
<li>After a few cards (or when ready), click <strong>"Next Phase"</strong> to move to the next step.</li>
<li>You‚Äôll continue through <strong>Support ‚Üí Exploration ‚Üí Challenge ‚Üí Creativity ‚Üí Action</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>üé≠ Example:</h3>
<p>Anna and Lukas are playing. Lukas is the Seeker.</p>
<blockquote>
        Anna: ‚ÄúWhat would you like to achieve in the next month?‚Äù<br/>
        Lukas: ‚ÄúI want to feel clear about my next career step.‚Äù<br/>
        Anna: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs explore that further...‚Äù<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>Together, they reflect using one card per step, gaining insight along the way.</p>
